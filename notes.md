# Musicality TODO

1. Hotkeys for (R)eplay Play | (N)ew Progression | Re(V)eal 

2. Input for Chord progression guess, show guess / actual, right / wrong and a tally

3. A way to generate tones, just generating them would be good. Would be good to be able to have some kind of musical MIDI that sounded like a guitar

4. Be able to determine which note is being played through audio input. A display like 'Simple Pitch' would be nice.

5. A metronome with
   i. Simple metronome
   ii. A metronome that increases tempo at a particular rate

# Exercises

## Scale Teacher
Once the input can be deduced, a way to display the fretboard with a scale then have each note light up when you play it. 
You can make a noise when the wrong note is played, keep track of mistakes.
The scale highlighting can slowly fade over time, so you are playing it without seeing the scale highlighted
A metronome could also be incorporated, it could increase tempo

## Interval Trainer

An interval is played, then it has to be played back on the guitar
